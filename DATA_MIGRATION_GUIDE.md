#### **About Section:**
```
About Section Title: "About Carla"
About Description:
"I'm a Senior Product UX/UI Designer originally from Panama, now based in the UK.

My path into design began by exploring how things work under the hood. I started my career as a front-end designer before moving into design fully â€” a journey that gave me a strong foundation for creating practical, buildable solutions.

Over the years, I've worked with start-ups, studios, and organisations across Italy, Germany, and the UK â€” shaping digital products and strategies that put people first. While I enjoy the full design process, I have a particular love for visual design (UI) and inclusive systems that scale.

And although I spend my days in the digital world, I still start every project the old-school way: pen and paper first, always.

When I'm not designing, you'll probably find me experimenting in the kitchen, learning a new language, or chasing after my daughter.

My family is at the centre of everything I do. They remind me daily that simplicity matters â€” and that maintaining a healthy work/life balance is key to showing up as my best self in both worlds."
