To provide an easy and intuitive way for personal trainers to manage their clients, streamline bookings, and keep track of payments effortlessly. It needed to be sleek, modern, and user-friendly.",
    solution: "The final product is an app that embraces the latest trends in fitness design. We focused on delivering a user experience that's both visually appealing and highly functional.\n\nThe dark theme with vibrant highlights gives the app a bold, modern look that fits well with the fitness space. From the home screen, trainers can quickly view upcoming sessions and stay on top of their schedule. The client management feature tracks how many sessions each client has purchased and used, helping trainers manage time and resources more effectively.\n\nThe payment tracking feature allows for easy monitoring of earnings and outstanding payments — reducing the burden of admin tasks. Whether it's scheduling, client progress, or payments, the app brings everything together in one clean, accessible experience.",
    impact: "It was a quick project, but I enjoyed the challenge. It was a great opportunity to apply a clean, functional design approach to a focused brief — and see how much clarity you can bring in a short space of time."

    overview: "This was part of a fast-paced design sprint exploring how the My Sky app could evolve beyond account management. The aim was to consider what a next-generation TV companion app might offer—thinking more in terms of everyday utility, personalisation, and connection.\n\nThrough a week of workshops and ideation sessions, we shaped a range of concepts which I then translated into over 50 high-fidelity screens. The designs here represent the strongest and most feasible directions that came out of that process.",
    challenge: "The app had a clear functional role but didn't yet support deeper engagement or a sense of personal connection.\n\nWe set out to explore:\n• How the app could support more personalised, daily-use features\n• What a more social or collaborative viewing experience might look like\n• Where we could introduce experimental ideas without disrupting the core product",
    solution: "We explored three main directions that balanced ambition with usability:\n\nSocial & Shared Viewing\nNew features like \"Friends Recommend\" allowed users to see what others were watching and share playlists—bringing a more human layer to the platform.\n\nEmotion-Based Recommendations\nA face scan tool was prototyped to detect mood and suggest content accordingly. While playful, it opened up space for conversations around adaptive UX.\n\nSmart Home Hub\nWe restructured the homepage to feel more useful day-to-day, integrating things like weather, news, and richer content previews to build habit and context.",
    technicalApproach: [
      "• Designed with modularity in mind, using familiar Sky UI patterns to help new features slot into the existing structure",
      "• Each concept was considered with technical feasibility and rollout in mind",
      "• Experimental features like face scan were framed as future-facing options rather than immediate releases",
      "• Created over 50 high-fidelity screens to demonstrate the concepts",
      "• Conducted workshops and ideation sessions to shape the direction"
    ],
    impact: "This was a fast-paced project that involved producing high-fidelity screens on a tight turnaround. It was intense but rewarding—especially seeing how some of the ideas generated in this early-stage sprint began shaping conversations across the wider product team.\n\nIt was also a great reminder of how helpful a rough but focused sprint can be for surfacing ideas, aligning teams, and setting design direction—even when not everything is destined for release."

    overview: "Sky set out to expand its Orion design system beyond web to support native mobile platforms, with the long-term goal of creating a unified, scalable system across apps, websites, and even TV interfaces. This project focused on defining mobile-specific components, improving accessibility, and aligning design with development through consistent naming and documentation practices.",
    challenge: "Existing web-based components didn't translate well to mobile, and there was no shared mobile toolkit that followed native platform guidelines. Accessibility considerations were inconsistent, and handoff between design and development lacked a common structure. A key technical objective was to define a component naming convention that could feed into Sky's internal AI algorithm — the 'Sky namespace' — which would eventually allow the system to recognise and manage components automatically. The bigger ambition was to establish a single source of truth that could scale across teams, products, and platforms.",
    solution: "We proposed a new set of components specifically for iOS and Android, based on native platform guidelines and accessibility standards. Alongside this, we established a shared naming system to ensure consistency between design and development. These components were documented clearly, with properties linked to specific product requirements, allowing for more reliable implementation and future reuse. To support adoption and collaboration, we created an internal toolkit for designers using Sketch and ran regular workshops to align stakeholders around ways of working, design principles, and system structure.",
    technicalApproach: [
      "• Partnered with UX, research, and development teams to define and design core components",
      "• Built a shared design toolkit in Sketch tailored to mobile apps",
      "• Documented component specs and behaviour for developers and business analysts",
      "• Led fortnightly workshops to align teams around naming, scalability, and cross-platform thinking",
      "• Delivered training across departments to educate teams on design system best practices",
      "• Created an interactive prototype in InVision to demonstrate how Orion could evolve into a centralised internal design hub"
    ],
    impact: "I took the lead in documenting and visualising how the Orion design system could function as a true internal resource. This included building a detailed InVision prototype that was shared across the organisation. It helped communicate the vision of Orion as a scalable system and encouraged wider team involvement.\n\nEventually, both the web and TV teams joined the initiative and began contributing their own components into the shared InVision workspace — a sign that Orion had become a collaborative, cross-team system with real momentum. It was exciting to see a design system move beyond a toolkit and start becoming a strategic asset for the business."

    overview: "As part of the broader GoSure brand initiative, we developed a new claims management system to support call centre agents handling customer insurance claims. The goal was to streamline complex processes, identify areas for automation, and create a tool that would not only improve efficiency but also support new agent onboarding.",
    challenge: "The existing claims process was manual, inconsistent, and difficult to manage—particularly when multiple agents were involved in a single claim. Information was scattered, making it time-consuming to follow up or provide updates. The business needed a centralised, intuitive solution that would save time, reduce errors, and support agents in providing a better experience to customers.",
    solution: "We designed a comprehensive, agent-focused dashboard that consolidates all essential claim data in one place. Key features include task management for tracking responsibilities across multiple agents, a clear process overview for improved visibility, mobile accessibility for on-the-go management, a training-friendly UX for new agent onboarding, and full integration with the established GoSure design system for consistency and scalability.",
    technicalApproach: [

      "- Intuitive task management system",
      "- Clear process visualization",
      "- Mobile-responsive design",
      "- Training and onboarding features",
      "- Design system integration",
      "The solution was built using Figma and followed the established GoSure design system to ensure consistency across platforms."
    ],
    impact: "I was instrumental in designing the wireframes and creating the final high-fidelity designs, ensuring everything aligned with our design system. I also collaborated closely with other designers through workshops and ideation sessions, where we explored different approaches to make the system truly agent-friendly. It was especially rewarding to design something that balanced operational efficiency with human-centred design. Knowing the dashboard would help ease the workload for agents—and support those just learning the ropes—made this project particularly meaningful."

    overview: "Covea needed a forward-thinking approach to unify and modernise its digital insurance experience. We created GoSure, a mobile-first brand designed to challenge outdated UX patterns, establish a new visual and verbal identity, and provide a collaborative foundation for future design system work across teams.",
    challenge: "Covea's existing product brands were inconsistent, outdated, and not designed with accessibility or mobile-first principles in mind. User journeys were inefficient and led to significant customer drop-off. Internally, design and development teams used different tools and had no single source of truth, leading to fragmented execution. On top of this, introducing future-thinking concepts within existing brand structures was nearly impossible without creating confusion among stakeholders.",
    solution: "We developed a completely new digital brand from the ground up: GoSure. This included naming, logo design, tone of voice, visual language, and a full set of brand rules. GoSure served not just as a brand, but as a North Star — paving the way for cohesive digital experiences and aligning teams across products. We introduced a component-based toolkit in Figma to improve collaboration and consistency across design and development. The brand also acted as a testbed for new features and innovations, including tech-first insurance ideas like licence scanning to quote.",
    technicalApproach: [
      "We benchmarked top industry competitors to inform GoSure's positioning and set a high design standard.",
      "Key elements included:",
      "- Logo, typography, colour palette, tone of voice, and iconography",
      "- A unified toolkit of reusable components",
      "- New UX patterns designed with mobile-first in mind",
      "- Redesigns of key journeys from scratch to reflect both business needs and modern user expectations",
      "Design mockups and interactive prototypes (created in Figma and After Effects) were used to communicate ideas and secure stakeholder buy-in. These concepts not only challenged internal thinking but many were approved and are now in production."
    ],
    impact: "GoSure became more than a new brand — it was a strategic shift in how Covea designs and delivers digital experiences. It provided a shared foundation for cross-functional teams, brought visual and UX consistency across journeys, and created space for innovation. It was particularly rewarding to see early concepts gain momentum and move into production, proving the value of investing in thoughtful, user-led design from the start."

    impact: "I really enjoyed this project because I learned so much from my colleagues and deepened my understanding of iOS app design — even experimenting a little with Swift to better design for the platform. I spent most of last year focused on this product, and the collaboration across the team was incredible. We got the app up and running within four months, which was a huge achievement.\n\nOf course, there were some bumps along the way, but the experience was one of the most rewarding I've had. It was a real team effort, and I'm proud of what we built together.\n\nWhile the company later shifted direction and the app's future became uncertain, we successfully delivered a fully functional, polished product. I'm proud of what we achieved together — and even if the roadmap paused, the experience shaped how I approach mobile design today.",

    overview: `To support Covea's growing portfolio of insurance products and platforms, there was a need for a centralised, flexible design system. The goal was to create a toolkit of adaptive components that could be reused across brands and projects, enabling faster delivery, reducing duplication, and improving collaboration between design and development teams.`,
    challenge: `The team needed a mobile-first, modular design system that could serve multiple customer-facing products and internal tools. Existing design efforts were fragmented, with duplicated work, inconsistent components, and slow feedback loops. Designers and developers were working in silos, lacking a shared language, process, or source of truth.`,

    solution: `We created a scalable design system with reusable, white label components that could be adapted for various customer products. The system included:

- A Figma toolkit for designers
- A matching React Storybook for developers
- Guidelines and documentation to ensure alignment across teams

To bridge communication, we introduced shared documentation in Confluence and set up regular workshops, catch-ups, and forums to support adoption. This created a more streamlined, collaborative environment across teams.`,
    technicalApproach: [`The design system was built on the foundations of the GoSure brand, establishing a clean, flexible UI style that could evolve with business needs.`,
      'Key activities included:',
      '- Identifying core component patterns and creating a design-led toolkit in Figma',
      '- Supporting developers in translating Figma components into interactive React elements',
      '- Creating documentation to define component behaviour, usage rules, and version control',
      '- Running fortnightly syncs to review progress and ensure cross-team alignment',
      '- Hosting workshops to onboard designers and introduce best practices around the system'
    ],
    impact: `My focus was on laying the design foundations — building the internal UI library, aligning it with the GoSure brand, and collaborating closely with developers to ensure accurate implementation.

While I didn't build the Storybook toolkit myself, I worked alongside the development team to help mirror the design system from Figma into React. We defined component variants, explored interaction patterns, and created a shared process that supported better cross-team collaboration. It was rewarding to see how this system brought clarity and consistency to projects across the organisation.`
