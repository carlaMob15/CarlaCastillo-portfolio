    overview: "Covea needed a forward-thinking approach to unify and modernise its digital insurance experience. We created GoSure, a mobile-first brand designed to challenge outdated UX patterns, establish a new visual and verbal identity, and provide a collaborative foundation for future design system work across teams.",
    challenge: "Covea's existing product brands were inconsistent, outdated, and not designed with accessibility or mobile-first principles in mind. User journeys were inefficient and led to significant customer drop-off. Internally, design and development teams used different tools and had no single source of truth, leading to fragmented execution. On top of this, introducing future-thinking concepts within existing brand structures was nearly impossible without creating confusion among stakeholders.",
    solution: "We developed a completely new digital brand from the ground up: GoSure. This included naming, logo design, tone of voice, visual language, and a full set of brand rules. GoSure served not just as a brand, but as a North Star — paving the way for cohesive digital experiences and aligning teams across products. We introduced a component-based toolkit in Figma to improve collaboration and consistency across design and development. The brand also acted as a testbed for new features and innovations, including tech-first insurance ideas like licence scanning to quote.",
    technicalApproach: [
      "We benchmarked top industry competitors to inform GoSure's positioning and set a high design standard.",
      "Key elements included:",
      "- Logo, typography, colour palette, tone of voice, and iconography",
      "- A unified toolkit of reusable components",
      "- New UX patterns designed with mobile-first in mind",
      "- Redesigns of key journeys from scratch to reflect both business needs and modern user expectations",
      "Design mockups and interactive prototypes (created in Figma and After Effects) were used to communicate ideas and secure stakeholder buy-in. These concepts not only challenged internal thinking but many were approved and are now in production."
    ],
    impact: "GoSure became more than a new brand — it was a strategic shift in how Covea designs and delivers digital experiences. It provided a shared foundation for cross-functional teams, brought visual and UX consistency across journeys, and created space for innovation. It was particularly rewarding to see early concepts gain momentum and move into production, proving the value of investing in thoughtful, user-led design from the start."

I spent most of last year focused on this product, and the collaboration across the team was incredible. We got the app up and running within four months, which was a huge achievement.\n\nOf course, there were some bumps along the way, but the experience was one of the most rewarding I've had. It was a real team effort, and I'm proud of what we built together.\n\nWhile the company later shifted direction and the app's future became uncertain, we successfully delivered a fully functional, polished product. I'm proud of what we achieved together — and even if the roadmap paused, the experience shaped how I approach mobile design today."
